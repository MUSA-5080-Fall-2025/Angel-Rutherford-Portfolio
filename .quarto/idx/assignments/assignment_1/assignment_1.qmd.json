For instance, the county with the largest margin of error, Forest County, lies on the cusp of exhibiting low confidence while the smallest margin of error, Elk County, is much closer to being high confidence than low. These discrepancies, in addition to general uncertainty, indicate a need for additional oversight when using income data from these counties for decision-making.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n```{r select-counties}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselected_counties <- county_data %>% \n  filter(county_name %in% c(\"Allegheny\", \"Carbon\", \"Forest\"))   %>%\n  select(county_name, median_incomeE, MOE_PCT, reliability)\n\nselected_counties\n```\n\n**Comment on the output:** Because my data possessed no findings with low confidence, I chose the top county from my \"Top 5 Counties Exhibiting High Uncertainty\" as my low confidence observation. A gradient in reliability, however, is still achieved as, as previously observed, the margins of error between both counties with estimations of moderate confidence range drastically.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

This may suggest that demographic data from less diverse communities is more likely to be unreliable.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n**Overall Pattern Identification**\nAcross all analyses, the smaller the community being surveyed, the less accurate the data would become. Although the counties that were chosen to be further analyzed at the tract level represented a gradient in income estimation reliability, they all shared similar unreliability in demographic data. Allegheny, the county with the smallest margin of error in income estimation, possessed the largest population of the chosen counties while Forest county, the county with the largest margin of error, possessed the smallest population. These counties similarly, however, possessed a disproportionately large number of white residents compare to other racial and ethnic groups and returned high margins of error in their demographic data.\n\n**Equity Assessment**\nThe county data here emphasizes that margins of error vary depending on the type of data collected and are influenced by both the absolute size of a population and its proportion within the broader population. More specifically, smaller groups such as counties with small populations and racial or ethnic minorities are more prone to data inaccuracies and thus more vulnerable to bias in algorithmic decision-making. For instance, the tract with the largest hispanic population, the smallest average population across all tracts, had an even larger margin of error. Decisions made based on the this demographic data may vastly misrepresent the true needs of the hispanic population.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**\nThe misrepresentation of vulnerable populations such as small or spatially uneven populations in data can result in algorithms using inaccurate inputs and thus, inherently reproducing non-representational outputs. Furthermore, the subjective choices made when analyzing data can also skew outputs.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations**\nTo mitigate these risks, the Department should identify margins of error and create thorough thresholds for interpretations of margins of errors. Certain thresholds should call for human oversight and require additional social, historical, and spatial explanations. \n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\ncounty_summary <-county_data%>%\n  mutate(\n    rec_for_algorithm= case_when(\n    reliability == \"High Confidence (<5%)\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n   reliability == \"Moderate Confidence (5%-10%)\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n    reliability == \"Low Confidence (>10%)\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )%>%\n  select(county_name, median_incomeE, MOE_PCT, reliability, rec_for_algorithm)%>%\n  arrange(desc(MOE_PCT))%>%\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"County Name\", \"Median Income ($)\", \"MOE Percentage(%)\", \"Reliability\", \"Algorithm Recommendation)\"),\n      caption = \"County-level Algorithmic Recommendations\",\n     digits=c(0,0,1,0,0)\n  )\ncounty_summary\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \nAllegheny, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, York, Northampton, Lehigh, Cumberland, Dauphin, Beaver, Luzerne, Washington, Schuylkill, Erie, Lackawanna, Butler, Lebanon, Centre, Somerset, Clearfield, Franklin, Lawrence, Susquehanna, Perry, Monroe, Tioga, Cambria, Jefferson, Mifflin, Venango, Blair, Bradford, Armstrong, Mercer, Fulton, Columbia, Wyoming, Clinton, Crawford, Fayette, Adams, Clarion, Lycoming, Potter, Bedford, Indiana, Huntingdon, McKean, Juniata, Wayne, Pike\n\n**Justification:**\nLow margins of error indicate reduced risk in algorithmic bias\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nSullivan, Union, Montour, Elk, Greene, Cameron, Snyder, Carbon, Warren\n\n**Justification:**\nAlthough these counties fall in the moderate confidence range, outcomes should be monitored to ensure appropriateness.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \nForest\n\n**Justifications:**\nAlthough Forest county falls in the moderate confidence range, it borders the low confidence range and likely should avoid automated decisions until the quality of data improves. \n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. How small or strict should data reliability ranges be?\n2. Would it be statistically meaningful to compare margin of error percentages of different variables?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 09/26/2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version R 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: \nhttps://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-aruth3/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounty selection was determined base on numerical values of reliability rather than categorical indications of reliability due to a lack of categorical variation.\n\n**Limitations:**\nCertain population percentage estimates returned values of infinity due to division by denominators with a value of zero. These results should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent meaningful statistical outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.

Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.\n\n```{r tract-demographics}\n# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names\n\n# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data\n# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter\nfind_codes <- county_data %>% \n  select(county_name, GEOID)%>%\n  filter(county_name %in% c(\"Allegheny\", \"Carbon\", \"Forest\"))   %>%\n  mutate(county_code = str_remove(GEOID, \"42\"))\nfind_codes\n\ntract_data <- get_acs(\n  geography =\"tract\",\n  variables= c(\n     white =\"B03002_003\",\n     black=\"B03002_004\",\n     hispanic=\"B03002_012\",\n     total_pop=\"B03002_001\"\n  ),\n  state = my_state,\n  county =c(003, 025, 053),\n  year = 2022,\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\ntract_data\n  \n# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()\n# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations\n# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar\n\nunreadable= str_split(tract_data$NAME, \";\", simplify =  TRUE)\n\ntract_data <-tract_data%>% \n  mutate(white_pct=(whiteE/total_popE)*100,\n         black_pct=(blackE/total_popE)*100,\n         hispanic_pct=(hispanicE/total_popE)*100,\n         tract_name=unreadable[,1],\n         county_name=str_remove(unreadable[,2], \"County\")\n        \n)\n\nglimpse(tract_data)\n```\n\n## 3.3 Demographic Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.\n\n```{r demographic-analysis}\n# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents\n# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract\nhighest_hispanic_pct <- tract_data %>%\n  arrange(desc(hispanic_pct))%>%\n  slice(1)\nglimpse(highest_hispanic_pct)\n# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()\n# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group\nsummary_by_county <- tract_data %>%\n  group_by(county_name) %>%\n  summarize(\n    number_of_tracts=n(),\n    mean_white_pct=round(mean(white_pct, na.rm = TRUE),1),\n    mean_black_pct=round(mean(black_pct, na.rm = TRUE),1),\n    mean_hispanic_pct=round(mean(hispanic_pct, na.rm = TRUE),1)\n  )\nsummary_by_county\n# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()\nsummary_by_county%>%\n kable(\n      col.names = c(\"County Name\", \"Total Tracts Per County\", \"Average of White Residents(%)\", \"Average of Black Residents(%)\", \"Average of Hispanic Residents (%)\"),\n      caption = \"Average Demographics Per County\",\n     digits=c(0,0,1,1,1)\n)\n```\n\n# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation\n\n## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables\n\n**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable\n- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%\n- Create summary statistics\n\n```{r demographic-moe}\n# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables\n# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)\n\n# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable\n# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement\ntract_data <-tract_data%>%\n  mutate(\n    white_moe_pct=(whiteM/whiteE)*100,\n    black_moe_pct=(blackM/blackE)*100,\n    hispanic_moe_pct=(hispanicM/hispanicE)*100,\n    moe_flag=ifelse(\n    white_moe_pct > 15 |\n    black_moe_pct > 15 |\n    hispanic_moe_pct > 15,\n    TRUE, FALSE)\n)\n\n# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues\n quality_summary <- tract_data%>%\n  count(moe_flag) %>%\n  mutate(\n    percentage = round(n/sum(n) * 100, 1),\n    total = sum(n)\n  )\nquality_summary\n```\n\n## 4.2 Pattern Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.\n\n```{r pattern-analysis}\n# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues\n# Calculate average characteristics for each group:\n# - population size, demographic percentages\n\n# Use group_by() and summarize() to create this comparison\nsummary_by_moe <- tract_data %>%\n  group_by(moe_flag) %>%\n  summarize(\n    number_of_tracts= n(),\n    mean_population=round(mean(total_popE, na.rm = TRUE),0),\n    mean_white_pct=round(mean(white_pct, na.rm = TRUE),1),\n    mean_black_pct=round(mean(black_pct, na.rm = TRUE),1),\n    mean_hispanic_pct=round(mean(hispanic_pct, na.rm = TRUE),1)\n  )\nsummary_by_moe\n# Create a professional table showing the patterns\nsummary_by_moe%>%\n kable(\n      col.names = c(\"Quality Issues (MOE > %15)\", \"Total Tracts Detected\", \"Average Total Population\", \"Average of White Residents(%)\", \"Average of Black Residents(%)\", \"Average of Hispanic Residents (%)\"),\n      caption = \"Average Demographics Per County\",\n     digits=c(0,0,0,1,1,1)\n)\n```\n\n**Pattern Analysis:** All of the tracts investigated possessed high margins of error and predominantly white communities. This may suggest that demographic data from less diverse communities is more likely to be unreliable.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n**Overall Pattern Identification**\nAcross all analyses, the smaller the community being surveyed, the less accurate the data would become. Although the counties that were chosen to be further analyzed at the tract level represented a gradient in income estimation reliability, they all shared similar unreliability in demographic data. Allegheny, the county with the smallest margin of error in income estimation, possessed the largest population of the chosen counties while Forest county, the county with the largest margin of error, possessed the smallest population. These counties similarly, however, possessed a disproportionately large number of white residents compare to other racial and ethnic groups and returned high margins of error in their demographic data.\n\n**Equity Assessment**\nThe county data here emphasizes that margins of error vary depending on the type of data collected and are influenced by both the absolute size of a population and its proportion within the broader population. More specifically, smaller groups such as counties with small populations and racial or ethnic minorities are more prone to data inaccuracies and thus more vulnerable to bias in algorithmic decision-making. For instance, the tract with the largest hispanic population, the smallest average population across all tracts, had an even larger margin of error. Decisions made based on the this demographic data may vastly misrepresent the true needs of the hispanic population.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**\nThe misrepresentation of vulnerable populations such as small or spatially uneven populations in data can result in algorithms using inaccurate inputs and thus, inherently reproducing non-representational outputs. Furthermore, the subjective choices made when analyzing data can also skew outputs.\n\n**Strategic Recommendations**\nTo mitigate these risks, the Department should identify margins of error and create thorough thresholds for interpretations of margins of errors. Certain thresholds should call for human oversight and require additional social, historical, and spatial explanations. \n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\ncounty_summary <-county_data%>%\n  mutate(\n    rec_for_algorithm= case_when(\n    reliability == \"High Confidence (<5%)\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n   reliability == \"Moderate Confidence (5%-10%)\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n    reliability == \"Low Confidence (>10%)\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )%>%\n  select(county_name, median_incomeE, MOE_PCT, reliability, rec_for_algorithm)%>%\n  arrange(desc(MOE_PCT))%>%\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"County Name\", \"Median Income ($)\", \"MOE Percentage(%)\", \"Reliability\", \"Algorithm Recommendation)\"),\n      caption = \"County-level Algorithmic Recommendations\",\n     digits=c(0,0,1,0,0)\n  )\ncounty_summary\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \nAllegheny, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, York, Northampton, Lehigh, Cumberland, Dauphin, Beaver, Luzerne, Washington, Schuylkill, Erie, Lackawanna, Butler, Lebanon, Centre, Somerset, Clearfield, Franklin, Lawrence, Susquehanna, Perry, Monroe, Tioga, Cambria, Jefferson, Mifflin, Venango, Blair, Bradford, Armstrong, Mercer, Fulton, Columbia, Wyoming, Clinton, Crawford, Fayette, Adams, Clarion, Lycoming, Potter, Bedford, Indiana, Huntingdon, McKean, Juniata, Wayne, Pike\n\n**Justification:**\nLow margins of error indicate reduced risk in algorithmic bias\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nSullivan, Union, Montour, Elk, Greene, Cameron, Snyder, Carbon, Warren\n\n**Justification:**\nAlthough these counties fall in the moderate confidence range, outcomes should be monitored to ensure appropriateness.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** \nForest\n\n**Justifications:**\nAlthough Forest county falls in the moderate confidence range, it borders the low confidence range and likely should avoid automated decisions until the quality of data improves. \n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. How small or strict should data reliability ranges be?\n2. Would it be statistically meaningful to compare margin of error percentages of different variables?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 09/26/2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version R 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: \nhttps://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-aruth3/\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounty selection was determined base on numerical values of reliability rather than categorical indications of reliability due to a lack of categorical variation.\n\n**Limitations:**\nCertain population percentage estimates returned values of infinity due to division by denominators with a value of zero. These results should be interpreted with caution as they do not represent meaningful statistical outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
