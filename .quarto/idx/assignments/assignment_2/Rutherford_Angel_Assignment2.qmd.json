The coordinate reference system for each dataset is as follows: **WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator** for county data, **WGS 84** for the hospital data, and **NAD83** for the census tracts.\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data \n\n```{r results='hide'}\n# Get demographic data from ACS\n\ntract_data <- get_acs(\n  geography=\"tract\",\n  variables= c(\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\"\n  ),\n  state = \"PA\",\n  year = 2022,\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\nover_65 = c(\"B01001_020\",\"B01001_021\",\"B01001_022\",\"B01001_023\",\n            \"B01001_024\",\"B01001_025\",\"B01001_044\",\"B01001_045\",\n            \"B01001_046\",\"B01001_047\",\"B01001_048\",\"B01001_049\")\n\nelderly_data = get_acs(\n  geography=\"tract\",\n  variables =c(over_65\n),\n  state = \"PA\",\n  year = 2022,\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\nover_65_E<- paste0(over_65, \"E\")\n\nelderly_data<- elderly_data%>%\n  mutate(elderly_pop = rowSums(elderly_data[, over_65_E], na.rm = TRUE))\n  \ntotal_elderly <-elderly_data%>%\n  select(GEOID,elderly_pop)\n\ntract_data <-left_join(tract_data, total_elderly, by=\"GEOID\")\n\n# Join to tract boundaries\n\ndata_with_bounds = left_join(census_tracts, tract_data, by=\"GEOID\")\ndata_with_bounds\n\nno_record= sum(is.na(tract_data$median_incomeE))\nno_record\n\nmedian_median= median(tract_data$median_incomeE, na.rm = TRUE)\nmedian_median\n\n```\n\nThe ACS data being used in this analysis is from **2022**. Excluding the **63 tracts** with missing income data, the median income across PA census tracts was **$70,188**.\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\n```{r results='hide'}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\ndata_with_bounds <- data_with_bounds%>%\n  mutate(\n    elderly_pct = elderly_pop/total_popE * 100)\n\nvulnerable_data <- data_with_bounds%>%\n  filter(median_incomeE < 36000 & elderly_pct > 20) \n  \n\nvulnerable_data\n\nprint((nrow(vulnerable_data)/nrow(data_with_bounds))*100)\n\n```\n\nThe income threshold I chose to identify tracts with low median income was a income less than **$36,000**, **approximately half of the median of all tracts**. The threshold used to identify large elderly populations was a population over **20%** elderly as it would indicate that **more than 1/5th of the tract's population was elderly**. These thresholds were defined to serve as measurements of tract vulnerability. Based on these vulnerability thresholds, **49 tracts** or **1.4%** of Pennsylvania census tracts were considered vulnerable.\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\n```{r results='hide'}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\nvulnerable_data <- st_transform(vulnerable_data,3365)\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, 3365)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\nvulnerable_distance <- vulnerable_data%>%\n  mutate(\n    distance_to_nearest= as.numeric(apply(st_distance(st_centroid(.),hospitals),\n    1, min)\n  ))\n\nvulnerable_distance\n\nmedian_distance= median(vulnerable_distance$distance_to_nearest , na.rm = TRUE)\nmedian_distance\n\nmax_distance = max(vulnerable_distance$distance_to_nearest , na.rm = TRUE)\nmax_distance\n\n```\nThe datasets' projected coordinate reference system were transformed to **3365**, **the ideal projection for Pennsylvania** and for **measuring distance in units** and **not distorting degrees of longitude and latitude**. The average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts was approximately **6395 feet**. The maximum distance was about **98,596 feet**. **Only 1 tract**, out all the vulnerable tracts, was more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n---\n\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\n```{r results='hide'}\n# Create underserved variable\nunderserved_tracts <- vulnerable_distance%>%\n  filter(distance_to_nearest > 79200)\n\nunderserved_tracts\n\nprint((nrow(underserved_tracts)/nrow(vulnerable_data))*100)\n```\n**Only one singular tract** is considered underserved by the condition of being more than 15 miles or 79,200 feet from the nearest hospital. This means that **2%** of tracts identified as vulnerable are underserved.

There are no patterns in underserved counties but there is a pattern in vulnerability as **most vulnerable counties have vulnerable populations less than 5,000**, indicating counties with smaller overall population.\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\ntop_10_counties <- formated_county_vulnerability %>%\n  slice_head(n=10)\n\n# Format as table with kable() - include appropriate column names and caption \ntop_10_counties %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, pct_underserved, avg_distance, total_vulnerable)%>%\n    kable(\n      col.names = c(\n\"County Name\", \n\"Percentage of Tracts Lacking Adequate Access to Hospitals (over 15 miles to nearest)\",\n\"Average Distance to Nearest Hospital (ft)\",\n\"Total Population of Vulnerable Tracts (tracts with 20% over the age of 65 and a median income less than 3600)\"),\n      caption = \"Top 10 Pennslyvania Counties to Prioritize Healthcare Investments Based on Vulnerability and Access\",\n     digits=c(0,1,1,1)\n)\n```\n\nDue to limited data availability for underserved counties, rankings were based on the ten counties with **the highest average distance**.\n---\n\n## Part 2: Comprehensive Visualization \n\n```{r}\n# Create county-level access map\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, st_crs(pa_counties))\ncounties_with_demographics <- pa_counties %>%\n  left_join(county_vulnerability, by = \"COUNTY_NAM\")\n\nggplot(counties_with_demographics) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = pct_underserved), color = \"black\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_sf(data = hospitals, color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    na.value = \"white\",\n    name = \"Percentage Underserved\",\n    labels = scales::label_number(suffix = \"%\"),\n    option = \"plasma\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Pennsylvania Counties with Vulnerable Tracts\\nand their Percentage of Underserved Vulnerable Tracts\",\n    subtitle = \"Red = Hospitals\",\n    caption = \"Source: ACS 2022\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()+\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust =0))\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### Map 2: Detailed Vulnerability Map \n\n```{r}\nhospitals <- st_transform(hospitals, st_crs(pa_counties))\nhospitals_with_counties <- hospitals %>%\n  st_join(pa_counties %>% select(COUNTY_NAM))\n\ncensus_tracts <- st_transform(census_tracts, st_crs(pa_counties))\n\ntarget_county <- pa_counties %>%\n  filter(FIPS_COUNT == underserved_tracts$COUNTYFP)\n\nmy_neighbors <- pa_counties %>%\n  st_filter(target_county, .predicate = st_touches)\n\n\nclipped_neighbor_tracts <- st_intersection(census_tracts, my_neighbors)\nclipped_target_tracts <- st_intersection(census_tracts, target_county)\n\nneighbor_hospitals <- hospitals_with_counties %>%\n  filter(COUNTY_NAM %in% my_neighbors$COUNTY_NAM)\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_sf(data = clipped_neighbor_tracts, color=\"black\")+\n  geom_sf(data = clipped_target_tracts, color=\"black\")+\n  geom_sf(data = target_county, fill=\"lightgray\", color=\"black\", alpha=0.7)+\n  geom_sf(data = my_neighbors, fill=\"white\", color=\"black\", alpha=0.7)+\n  geom_sf(data = underserved_tracts, fill= \"blue\")+\n  geom_sf(data = neighbor_hospitals, color=\"red\", size=2)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Surrounding Pennsylvania Counties and Tracts of the Underserved Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Red = Hospitals, Blue = Underserved Tract\",\n    caption = \"Source: ACS 2022\")+\n  theme_void()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5))\n\n```\n---\n\n### Chart: Distribution Analysis\n\nCreate a visualization showing the distribution of distances to hospitals for vulnerable populations.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create distribution visualization\n\nggplot(county_vulnerability, aes(x = COUNTY_NAM, y = avg_distance)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Plot Average Distance to Hospitals Across Vulnerable Tracts By County\",\n       x = \"County Name\", \n       y = \"Average Distance (feet)\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n  panel.grid.major = element_blank())\n\n```\nThis bar chart shows the average distance to hospitals across vulnerable tracts by Pennsylvania counties.
