### Research Question

- What factors (structural, census, spatial etc. ) most significantly impact the predictive accuracy of house price models?


**Sub-questions:**

- “Which factors are most influential in determining house price prediction outcomes?”

- “To what extent are house prices predictable, and to what extent are they driven by unobservable factors?”

- “Does the predictive performance of the model remain consistent across neighborhoods of varying wealth levels?”

---

### Data Sources

- **Census ACS (American Community Survey, 2022)**  

- **OpenDataPhilly**  
  - Philadelphia Properties and Current Assessments (2023-2024)
   
  - Crime Incidents: Citywide crime incident reports
  
  - Universities: Spatial locations of educational institutions
  
  - Neighborhood Boundaries: Official neighborhood and planning district shapefiles

### Exploratory Data Analysis

---

### Model Building

**Build models progressively:**

**Model 1:** Structural features only  
- number of bathrooms, livable area (logged), garage spaces, house age (Quadratic Effect), exterior condition  

**Model 2:** Census variables  
- median_income, percentage of bachelor, percentage of poverty  

**Model 3:** Spatial features  
- nearest college, number of nearby crime  

**Model 4:** Interactions and fixed effects  
- neighborhood wealthy (interact with livable area)

### Comparison table

**Model Performance Improves with Each Layer**

| Model | CV RMSE (log) | R² |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| Structural Only | 0.61 | 0.35 |
| + Census | 0.50 | 0.57 |
| + Spatial | 0.49 | 0.58 |
| + Interactions/FE | 0.48 | 0.59 |


**Fourth Model RMSE:** \$154,200

### Model Validation

---

### Model 4 Performance Summary

- **Adjusted R² = 0.591** → explains nearly **59% of variation** in sale price
- Major improvement from **Model 1 (R² = 0.35)** after adding neighborhood and spatial features  

**Key Takeaway**

> The final interaction model effectively captures both **structural** and **contextual** determinants of housing prices in Philadelphia, combining property-level features with socioeconomic and spatial characteristics.

## Which Features Matter Most?

| Feature | Direction | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Living area** | ↑ | Strongest driver of housing price |
| **Age + Age²** | ↓ then ↑ | U-shaped pattern — older historic homes regain value |
| **Exterior good** | ↑ | Maintenance condition positively impacts price |
| **Median income / Education** | ↑ | Socioeconomic context drives demand |
| **Poverty rate / Crime** | ↓ | Negative neighborhood effects |
| **Interaction: Living area × Wealthy neighborhood** | ↓ | Larger homes add less

### Equity Concerns

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](figures/residual.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Price determinants vary by **neighborhood wealth**  
- Model performs best in **mid-range markets**, less stable in low-value areas  
- Hardest Neighborhoods to predict: Nicetown, Fairhill, and Upper Kensington  
- Introduce **spatial autoregressive or equity-weighted models**

### Model Limitations and Next Steps

**Key Limitations**

- **Spatial autocorrelation:** Some clustering remains in residuals — spatial lag or error models could improve performance.  
- **Omitted variables:** Missing data on school quality, zoning, renovation, and accessibility likely affect price variation.  
- **Equity bias:** Predictive accuracy varies by neighborhood wealth; uniform valuation may reinforce systemic disparities.

**Next Steps**

- Consider **other spatial features** to help magnify spatial patterns 
- Extend analysis with **temporal dimension** (panel data) to capture price dynamics over time.

---

### Policy Recommendations

  - Risk of encoding structural inequalities from historical disinvestment
  
  - Introduce equity-weighted adjustments or localized calibration for underrepresented areas

  - Use residual maps to guide targeted reinvestment and housing policy

---

### Conclusion 

- Limitations: 
  - observations omitted during dating cleaning 
  - equity bias
